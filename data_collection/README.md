# Raw Issue Data Collection Project

This code is dedicated to the collection and versioning of raw issue data.

## Process Overview

The data handling process is divided into two main stages:

1.  **Data Collection**: For instructions on how to collect raw task instances, please refer to the documentation in the `collect` directory.
2.  **Data Versioning**: Once the data is collected, please follow the versioning guidelines outlined in the `versioning` directory to properly label and manage the dataset.
